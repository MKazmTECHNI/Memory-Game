# Simple Memory game to copy paste

Originally for school project, but decided to upgrade it and paste into my github in case anyone would be looking for simple copy paste minigame.

## How to paste it?

**You really don't have to read it, your intuition should be enough.**
But if you do:

1. Paste needed script from [memory-game.html](memory-game.html) into wherever you need it

(It shouldn't collide with any class I believe)

2. Paste needed style (unless you want to restyle it) from [memory-game.css](memory-game.css) into your css file, or just keep the file itself.

(Remember to remove `body {}` styling)

3. I'd advise to copy the **file** of [memory-game.js](memory-game.js), and link it

(You don't have to, but I think if you paste it into already existing sctipt, it's gonna be overkill for it's readability)
